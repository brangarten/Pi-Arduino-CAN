<p align="center">Reads CAN Protocol using CAN Bus Shield on Arduino parsing it through Serial for the Pi</p>

---
## TLDR
Uses **Arduino R4 Minima** and **Raspberry Pi 3B+** to recieve information about a cars information using the **CAN protocol**. The Arduino in this case handles the CAN parsing and the Pi is the graphical interface for the car.

## Why use PI and Arduino instead of one or the other?
It's true that you can use one over the other in my case I already owned an Arduino for the initial project. 

> Initially it was going to be an Arduino with the CAN Bus Shield and an OLED screen to display information fetched from the car's ECU. 

While I was concepting how to gather everything together into a one big device, all while being inside my car, I realized I can stuff the Arduino and everything else alongside inside a storage bin I have. 

> My dash kit is Double-DIN. I currently have a radio on one unit and a storage bin below it. For this project I had to swap it around. 

So, I opted in on buying a PI and 7" Screen to display information parsed through the Arduino into the PI. <ins>This leaves memory fetching to the Arduino and graphical display to the PI</ins>.
